                Established in 2003, Academy of Technology is one of the most acclaimed self-financed engineering colleges in West Bengal.<br>
                 It has been established by Ananda Educational Development & Charitable Organisation (AEDCO), a trust known for its deep <br>
                sense of social commitment and dedicated to the promotion of education by inculcating appropriate ethics and attitude.<br>

                In a metamorphosis of over 18 years, Academy of Technology has been reinventing itself constantly to explore the infinite<br>
                possibilities of engineering and technology â€“ an academy that inspires everyone to think differently. It is now the preferred <br>
                career destination for meritorious students due to its academic integrity and standard as well as its attractive campus placement.
